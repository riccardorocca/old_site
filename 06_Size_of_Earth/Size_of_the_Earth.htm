      we started saying that we wanted to measure the size of the earth, our
      friends wondered whether we were insane.<br>
      After all, if you really want to know it, you can simply check in any
      basic atlas of astronomy.</small></p><small>

      </small><p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;" align="left"><small>But that was too
      obvious. Instead we wanted to actually measure it ourselves, because we
      were fascinated by the stories of those men who did the same thing for the
      first time thousands of years ago.<br>
      We wanted to experience their same emotions as they were discovering more
      and more about the world around them.<br>
      For instance that the earth is not flat but is rather a sphere and that it
      can be measured using simple instruments available to everyone. </small></p><small>

      degrees north of the equator.</small><p><small>The two locations that we chose were:<br>
      - the Boat Yard "Knorr Marine", in Victoria Island<br>
      - the Beach Hut of our friend Vivian, at Eleko</small></p><small>
      </small><p><small>We measured the distance between them using the odometer of our car:<br>
      - 0 km at the Beach Hut<br>
      - 2.9 km at P2 (entrance gate to Eleko Beach)<br>
      - 6.9 km at P1 (junction along the road to Epe)<br>
      - 55.8 km at the Boat Yard</small></p><small>
      </small><p><small>The road is not very straight, but we considered this inaccuracy
      acceptable for our method.<br>
      We did not count the piece of road between P1 and P2, because it runs
      North-South.<br>
      We also removed the piece between the Beach Hut and P2 from the total
      count.</small></p><small>
      </small><p><small>The distance that we calculated was therefore:<br>
      &nbsp; (Boat_Yard - P1) - (P2 - Beach_Hut)</small></p><small>

      </small><p><small>We later checked on a map and we measured the actual distance of 43 km
      between the two points.<br>
      Thus we were confident that our rudimental method was accurate enough.</small></p></td><small>

      Yard and the other one went to the Beach Hut.</small></p><small>

      curve of best fit along the points.
      </small><p><small>Where the curve is lowest, there is the local midday.</small></p><small>
      </small><p><small>For these data that were collected at the Beach Hut, one group
      calculated the local midday at 12:41</small></p><small>
      </small><p><small>Unfortunately no measurements could be taken at the Boat yard, because
      it kept on raining all the time.<br>
      We decided therefore to get this second value using a <a href="Size_of_Earth_Software.htm"> software</a> that
      calculates the local midday of any place in the world, given the
      coordinates of the place and the day of the observation.</small></p><small>
      </small><p><small>With the help of a GPS we obtained the input data:<br>
      - Longitude: 3&deg; 26.198'<br>
      - Latitude: 6&deg; 26.403'<br>
      - Date: 11th May 2003</small></p><small>
      </small><p><small>And from the software we obtained the local midday at the Boat Yard:
      12h:42min:41sec or 12h:42.68min</small></p><small>
      </small><p><small>In conclusion, the time interval between the local midday at the two
      location is:<br>
      12:42.68 - 12:41.00 = 1.68 minutes</small></p><small>

<p style="font-family: Verdana;"><small>D = distance between the two locations = 46 km<br>
24-hours = 24 x 60 minutes = 1440 minutes<br>
dT = time interval between the two locations = 1.68 minutes<br>
<br>
<b><font size="4"><small>earth_circumference = 46 x 1440 / 1.68 = 39350 km</small></font></b></small></p>

39350 / 6.28 = 6263 km</small></font></b></small></p>
<p style="font-family: Verdana;"><small>Considering that the actual earth circumference at the equator is 40075 km and that the actual earth radius is 6378 km, our calculation is only
1.8% off.</small></p>

science and friendship.</small></p>

<p style="font-family: Verdana;" align="center"><small>And ... how do you know the latitude of your location ?<br>
Well, you can simply read it on a map, but if you are a serious scientist then
you would measure it yourself, looking for instance at the North Star...<br>
But this is a different story. For now enjoy a bit more of our experiment taking
